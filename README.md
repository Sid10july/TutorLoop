# TutorLoop: The Overview 
The following is a full-stack development project I worked on over the course of a six-month period between February 2021 and July 2021. However, I continued with software updates, incorporating client feedback, and testing well into November of the same year. This product was developed for Singh's Tutoring Center to manage and retain students during the extended COVID lockdown, where online learning had become the norm and the biggest challenge seemed to be managing the education of public school (low-income) students. To read more about why I created this product please click [here](#tutorloop-why-tutorloop). This project features a dynamic website, aptly named TutorLoop, that was built primarily with PHP along with MySQL database and the CodeIgniter Framework. It also features Hack (the php extension), CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. To get a better understanding of the use cases of this project please click  [here](Tutor_Loop_zip/Tutor%20Loop%2010-3-21/README.md) or watch my tutorial video [here](https://youtu.be/o9hRWyGeyrc).
