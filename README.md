# TutorLoop: The Overview 
The following is a full-stack development project I worked on over the course of a six-month period between February 2021 and July 2021. However, I continued with software updates, incorporating client feedback, and testing well into November of the same year. This product was developed for Singh's Tutoring Center to manage and retain students during the extended COVID lockdown, where online learning had become the norm and the biggest challenge seemed to be managing the education of public school (low-income) students. Click [here](#tutorloop-why-tutorloop) to read more about why I created this product. This project features a dynamic website, aptly named TutorLoop, that was built primarily with PHP along with MySQL database and the CodeIgniter Framework. It also features Hack (the php extension), CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.

# TutorLoop: Why TutorLoop? 
Mr. Singh was a public school teacher at Delhi Public School in Delhi, India. For the past 5 years, Mr. Singh has been running a semi-informal tutoring center with the help of other teachers. With the mode of instruction switching to online learning during COVID, and board exams creeping ever closer, many students sought out his relatively cheap tutoring as a means to keep up with their education. Managing the new influx of students became a hassle as communicating over direct messages and group chats became exceedingly inefficient. It is to meet this demand that I created TutorLoop â€“ a website that could manage the scale of several students independently.
