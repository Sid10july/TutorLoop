# TutorLoop
The following is a full-stack development project I worked on over the course of a six-month period between February 2021 and July 2021. However, I continued with software updates and testing well into November of the same year. This product was developed for Singh's Tutoring Center to manage and retain students during the extended COVID lockdown, where online learning had become the norm and the biggest challenge seemed to be managing the education of public school (low-income) students.
